# isithometimeyet
Another joke page created after a loonnnnnggg day at a previous workplace to tell you if it's hometime yet based on a specified time.

The initial implementation is stored in the root, with a vue-js implementation (my first vue.js attempt at anything I might add!) in a subdirectory.
